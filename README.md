@Amine <br>
It was quiet, until the light in the window blinked once.
Someone, or something, had arrived.


@Wiktor <br>
The door creaked open without a sound.
Cold air slipped inside, carrying the scent of rain and rust.


@Zivile <br>
The dark figure crawled into the room.  
A whispering, creaking voice waved through the floor, begging for air.

@Brigi <br>
From beneath the floorboards came a rhythmic tapping—impatient, deliberate.
The room held its breath, waiting for the next intrusion.
