@Amine <br>
It was quiet, until the light in the window blinked once.
Someone, or something, had arrived.


@Wiktor <br>
The door creaked open without a sound.
Cold air slipped inside, carrying the scent of rain and rust.


@Zivile <br>
The dark figure crawled into the room.  
A whispering, creaking voice waved through the floor, begging for air.


@Brigi <br>
From beneath the floorboards came a rhythmic tapping‚Äîimpatient, deliberate.
The room held its breath, waiting for the next intrusion.


@welde <br>
The lights flickered as if something had just entered. 
The figure stopped and looked around slowly.  
It felt like the walls were holding their breath.  

@Amine <br>
Then, a faint hum began to rise ‚Äî low at first, then swelling like a chorus of trapped voices.
The figure tilted its head, listening, as the shadows seemed to move closer.

@Wiktor <br>
The hum fractured into sharp, metallic whispers that circled the room like blades. 
The figure reached out‚Äîand the walls finally exhaled.

@Zivile <br>
The figure revealed his face, which was shocking.
It was furious and full of rage.

@Brigi <br>
With a sudden roar, the figure slammed his hand against the nearest wall, and the entire room shuddered like a living thing in pain. From the cracks that spread outward, a blinding light began to seep through‚Äîpulsing, alive, and watching.


@welde <br>
It felt like the walls were holding their breath.  


@Amine <br>
Then, in the silence that followed, the house itself seemed to whisper a single word ‚Äî a name none of them had ever spoken, yet all somehow knew.


@wiktor <br>
The light burst outward, swallowing sound and shape alike.
When it dimmed, the figure was gone- but the tapping beneath the floor had started again.


@Zivile <br>
A cold shiver ran down my spine as the echoes of the tapping grew louder, more deliberate. Shadows danced along the walls, though no one was there to cast them.


@Brigi <br>
I took a step back, but the floor felt soft‚Äîlike something beneath it was shifting, breathing. Then, from the darkest corner of the room, a voice whispered ‚ÄúYou let him out.‚Äù
